definition: |
  The `StandardReferencesSection` class within _StandardDocument_
  is used to represent a bibliography section.
  It is used to collate references within the document, where
  there could be one or more of such sections within a document.

  For example, some standardization documents differentiate
  normative or informative references, some split references into
  sections organized by concept relevance.

  The `StandardReferencesSection` class is a specialized class of
  `StandardSection` (<<standardssection>>).

  Similar to the `ReferencesSection` of the `BasicDocument` model
  (<<basicdocument>>), they are leaf nodes which contain zero or more
  bibliographical references (as modelled in <<relaton>>), along with
  any prefatory text.
