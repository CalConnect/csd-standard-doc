  Definition sections (`DefinitionSection`) consist of one or more definition lists (`DefinitionCollection`)
  (see <<basicdocument>>), and are used to define symbols and
  abbreviations used in the remainder of the document.

  They can also be used as glossaries, with simple definitions,
  in contrast to the more elaborate definitions given in
  terms sections (<<termsection>>).

  In addition to allowing prefatory text per section, each definition list
  within each definition section can also be preceded by prefatory text.
