name: StandardDocument
modelType: class
definition: |
  The `StandardDocument` model is used to represent a standardization
  document.

  Typically, a standardization document contains at least the
  following data elements:

  * Metadata information;
  * Clauses and subclauses;
  * Bibliographies;
  * Annexes if applicable.

  The exact component requirements of a standardization document
  can differ widely from one standardization body to the next.
  Specialization is necessary to adopt the `StandardDocument`
  model for such standardization bodies.

  The `StandardDocument` model extends the `BasicDocument`
  modelling of the document by requiring specific types
  of sections.
