== Section elements

=== Purpose

A section represents a clause in a standardization document.
Specifically, a section represents a logically coherent group of
paragraphs and blocks that is meant to be shown in the table
of contents.

=== Structure

The `StandardDocument` model is a specialization of the
`BasicSection` class of the `BasicDocument` model by as
follows:

* All sections in a `StandardDocument` model are instances of the
`StandardSection` class, which is a subclass of `BasicSection`.

* The `StandardSection` class indicates its status as normative or
informative explicitly, through the `status` attribute.
The normative status of individual sections in a standardization
document is pertinent.
====
The necessity of indicating normative or informative `status`
is specified in <<isoiecdir2>> for ISO deliverables.
====

There are two major types of sections, namely, clause sections and
content sections.

=== Clause sections

Clause sections (`ClauseSection`) are numbered, and form part of the
main flow of the document.

Clause sections are by default hierarchical (as an exception, see <<terms>>).
The subclauses of Clauses are themselves Clause Sections; they
continue the hierarchical numbering of Clause Sections at deeper
hierarchical levels.

=== Content sections

Content sections (`StandardHierarchicalSection`) are optionally
not numbered, and lie outside the main flow of the document.

In `StandardDocument`, there are four distinctly named
content sections. These content sections are designated sections
as they recur in standardization documents and have distinct semantics:

* Abstract,
* Foreword,
* Introduction, and
* Acknowledgments.

Specializations of the model may define other such sections.

The subclauses of Content sections are ``StandardSection``s,
and need not be numbered.

=== Annex sections

Annexes are implemented as ``ClauseSection``s in the
`StandardDocument` metamodel.

They are, however, expected to be numbered differently, and to be
rendered as separate sequences from clause sections.

=== Category label

Both section types can have a category label, which allows them
to be semantically classified into recurring categories, which
may be processed and rendered differently.
Indicative values include:

* `executive-summary`,
* `errata`,
* `methods`,
* `requirements`,
* `tests`,
* `reagents`, and
* `tests`.



=== Restrictions on hanging elements

Generally, in standardization documents there is a strong need
to reference text in clauses unambiguously by clause number,
which makes hanging paragraphs undesirable.

Therefore, the `StandardDocument` model requires "hanging paragraphs"
to be avoided. In particular, its sections should
contain either blocks or subsections, but not both.

NOTE: The avoidance of "hanging paragraphs" is also a requirement in
<<isoiecdir2>>.

While this behavior is less pressing for Content sections (which are
unnumbered), and Annexes (as exemplified in <<isoiecdir2>>), it is
nonetheless not recommended.
