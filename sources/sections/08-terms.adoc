== Terms and definition elements

=== Purpose

Standardization documents are used to convey normative information;
to achieve so it is imperative to provide a standardized set of
terms and definitions.

=== General

The `StandardDocument` model provides two further subclasses of
clause sections (`ClauseSection`):

* Definition section, and
* Term section.

Both types of section can include prefatory text.


=== Definition sections

Definition sections (`DefinitionSection`) consist of one or more definition lists
(see <<basicdocument>>), and are used to define symbols and
abbreviations used in the remainder of the document.

They can also be used as glossaries, with simple definitions,
in contrast to the more elaborate definitions given in
terms sections (<<termsection>>).

In addition to allowing prefatory text per section, each definition list
within each definition section can also be preceded by prefatory text.


[[termsection]]
=== Term sections

Term sections (`TermsSection`) give elaborated definitions of terms used in
a standardization document.

A `StandardDocument` can contain one or more ``TermSection``s.
Term sections consist of zero or more Terms.

NOTE: The `TermsSection` definition fully aligns with the structure
and requirements of the "Terms and definition" section given in
<<isoiecdir2>>.


[[term]]
=== Term

A term (`Term`) is composed of the following elements:

`id`:: An optional identifier for the term, to be used in
cross-references.

`preferred`:: One or more names under which the term being defined
is canonically known.

`admitted`:: Zero or more names which are acceptable synonyms for
the term being defined.

`related`:: Zero or more names which are related to the term being
defined. Each has a type, indicating how the term is related;
permitted values are compare (for "see also" references to terms),
contrast (for terms that illuminate the term definition as what it
is not), see (if this is a deprecated term, to reference the
preferred term)

`deprecates`:: Zero or more names which are deprecated synonyms for
the term being defined.

`domain`:: An optional semantic domain for the term being defined,
in case the term is ambiguous between several semantic domains.

`grammar`:: Zero or more abbreviations giving grammatical
information about the term (e.g. part of speech, gender)

`definition`:: The definition of the term applied in the current
document.

`note`:: Zero or more notes about the term.

`example``:: Zero or more examples of how the term is to be used.

`source`:: Zero or more bibliographical sources for the term. These
include the `origin` of the term, which is its bibliographical
citation (as defined in <<relaton>>); the `status` of the
definition (whether `identical` to the definition given in the
origin cited, or `modified`); and, if the definition is modified, a
description of the `modification` to the definition applied for
this document.

NOTE: The `Term` definition fully aligns with the structure
and requirements of terms in <<isoiecdir2>>.


=== Nested sections

Both definition and term sections are leaf nodes, and cannot
contain subclauses of their own.

Nested definition and term sections should be modelled as
``ClauseSection``s with subclauses, terminating in
definition and term sections.
