[[terms]]
== Terms and definition elements

=== Purpose

Standardization documents are used to convey normative information;
to achieve so it is imperative to provide a standardized set of
terms and definitions.

=== General

The `StandardDocument` model provides two further subclasses of
clause sections (`ClauseSection`):

* Definition section, and
* Term section.

Both types of section can include prefatory text.


=== Definition sections

=== Term sections

....


[[term]]
=== Term

[datamodel]
....
include::../models/views/Term.yml[]

=== Nested sections

Both definition and term sections are leaf nodes, and cannot
contain subclauses of their own.

Nested definition and term sections should be modelled as
``ClauseSection``s with subclauses, terminating in
definition and term sections.
