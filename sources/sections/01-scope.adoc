== Scope

This document provides a document metamodel for standardization
documents and describes its alignment to standardization
processes.

The document metamodel relies on models from the following standards:

* <<basicdocument>>, where modelling of textual content
(at the block and inline level), and of changes to documents,
form part of the reference model in this standard;

* <<relaton>>, where modelling of bibliographies and
bibliographic citations form part of the reference model in this standard.

Implementation of the metamodel and serialization formats are
out of scope of this document.

The derivation and mapping of the reference model to
representation formats is out of scope of this document.

This document provides example profiles for ISO and
CalConnect standards in <<isoprofile>> and <<csdprofile>>,
prescription of profiles of the document metamodel
for particular standardization bodies is not in scope
of this document.
