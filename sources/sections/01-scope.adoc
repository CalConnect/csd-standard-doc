== Scope

This document provides a document metamodel for standardization
documents and describes its alignment to standardization
processes.

The following aspects of the document metamodel are out of scope:

* implementation of the document metamodel into a document model;
* derivation and mapping of the reference model to representation
formats (such as for serialization); and
* prescription of profiles of the document metamodel
for particular standardization bodies.

Example profiles provided for ISO and CalConnect standards in
<<isoprofile>> and <<csdprofile>> are presented for informative
reasons.
