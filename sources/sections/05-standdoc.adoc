== StandardDocument

=== Purpose

The `StandardDocument` model is used to represent a standardization
document.

Typically, a standardization document contains at least the
following data elements:

* Metadata information;
* Clauses and subclauses;
* Bibliographies;
* Annexes if applicable.

The exact component requirements of a standardization document
can differ widely from one standardization body to the next.
Specialization is necessary to adopt the `StandardDocument`
model for such standardization bodies.


=== Structure

The `StandardDocument` model extends the `BasicDocument`
modelling of the document by requiring the following specific types
of section:

* An optional _boilerplate_ section, intended to appear at the
front of the document. It consists of content addressing
_copyright_, _license_, _legal_, and _feedback_ concerns
(each as a `StandardHierarchicalSection`: <<standardssection>>).

* Zero or more optional _preface_ sections (each as a `StandardHierarchicalSection`: <<standardssection>>).

* One or more _sections_ (each as a `StandardHierarchicalSection`).

* Zero or more _annexes_ (each as a `StandardHierarchicalSection`).

* Zero or more _bibliographies_ (each as a `StandardReferencesSections`:
<<standardsreferencessection>>).
