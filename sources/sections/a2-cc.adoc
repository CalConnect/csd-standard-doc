== CSD Standard Document Model Profile

=== General

The _CSD Standard Document_ model is given here as an exemplar of
the application of Metanorma modelling to a particular standard
(standards published by the Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium).

=== Document, Section

The _CSD Standard Document_ model extends the `StandardDocument`
modelling of the document by requiring the following specific types
of section:

* An optional _Foreword_ (a Standards Hierarchical Section: <<standardssection>>).

* An optional _Introduction_ (a Standards Hierarchical Section: <<standardssection>>).

* One or more Clause Sections (<<standardssection>>).

* Zero or more Annexes (<<standardssection>>).

[[csdblock]]
=== Block

The _CSD Standard Document_ model extends the `StandardDocument`
modelling of blocks for one block definition:

* The definition of Figure is altered to allow Ascii art as an
option for its content, as a string (`pre`). As with Sourcecode
(<<basicsourcecode>>), the string should be treated as pre-formatted
text, with whitespace treated as significant.


=== Inline Elements

The _CSD Standard Document_ model extends the `StandardDocument`
modelling of inline elements by one element:

* The `keyword` element is added as a subclass of Text Element
(<<textelements>>). The element is used to represent code keywords,
as with `code` in HTML, and should be rendered in monospace.


=== Bibliography

The provisos which apply to ISO bibliographic entries (<<isobib>>)
also apply here.

The bibliographic modelling of CSD documents is enriched compared
to <<relaton>> as follows:

* The document type is constrained to be one of the following:
_Code, Presentation, Proposal, Standard, Report_.

* The document status is constrained to be one of the following:
_Proposal, Working Draft, Committee Draft, Final Draft, Published,
Withdrawn_.

* The editorial group responsible for the document is defined with
a single components: a mandatory Technical Committee. The Technical
Committee has a type of either _Technical_ or _Provisional_.
