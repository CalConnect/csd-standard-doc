== Profile: CalConnect standardization deliverables

=== General

This profile provides the specialization of the
_StandardDocument_ document metamodel for CalConnect standardization deliverables
described in <<CC10002>>.

The `CsdStandardDocument` model fully covers all CalConnect
standardization deliverables, including Standards,
Reports, Specifications, Directives, Guides, Amendments and Corrigenda.


=== Document and section specialization

The `CsdStandardDocument` model extends the `StandardDocument`
modelling of the document by requiring the following specific types
of section:

* An optional _Foreword_ (a `StandardsHierarchicalSection`, see <<standardssection>>).

* An optional _Introduction_ (a `StandardsHierarchicalSection`, see <<standardssection>>).

* One or more clause sections (see <<standardssection>>).

* Zero or more Annexes (see <<standardssection>>).


[[csdblock]]
=== Block specialization

The `Block` model is specialized:

* The definition of Figure is altered to allow ASCII artwork as an
option for its content, as a string (`pre`). As with the sourcecode element
(<<basicdocument>>), the string should be treated as pre-formatted
text, with whitespace treated as significant.


=== Inline elements specialization

The `CsdStandardDocument` model extends the `StandardDocument`
modelling of inline elements by one element:

* The `keyword` element is added as a subclass of Text Element
(<<basicdocument>>). The element is used to represent code keywords,
as with `code` in HTML, and should be rendered in monospace.


=== Document metadata specialization

////
The provisions which apply to ISO bibliographic entries (<<isobib>>)
also apply here.

The bibliographic modelling of CalConnect documents is further enriched compared
to `BibliographicItem` as follows:

* The document type is constrained to be one of the following:
** `Standards`,
** `Reports`,
** `Specifications`,
** `Directives`,
** `Guides`,
** `Amendments`,
** `Corrigenda and Administrative`.

* The document status is constrained to be one of the following:
** `Proposal`,
** `Working Draft`,
** `Committee Draft`,
** `Final Draft`,
** `Published`,
** `Withdrawn`.

* The editorial group responsible for the document is defined with
a single components: a mandatory Technical Committee. The Technical
Committee has a type of either `Technical` or `Provisional`.
