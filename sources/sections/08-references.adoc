== References Section

Standard References Sections are a subclass of `StandardSection`.

Like the References Sections of the `BasicDocument` model
(<<basicdocument>>), they are leaf nodes which contain zero or more
bibliographical references (as modelled in <<relaton>>), along with
any prefatory text.
