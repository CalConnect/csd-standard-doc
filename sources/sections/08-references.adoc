and as a result they usually contain a bibliography section
indicating its data sources.

=== Reference item

Each reference item is represented using the _BibliographicItem_
class defined in <<relaton>>.

It is not necessary to specialize reference items amongst
documents from different standardization bodies as a document
can cite documents of any type.


=== Citation

Each citation is represented by the _Citation_ class defined in
<<relaton>>.

It is not necessary to specialize citations since it is simply
a document data element reference linked to a reference item.
